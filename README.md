# short-url
Rest API service that shortens URLs using short codes
# Tech used
- Flask 
- SQLITE DB: 
**Reason**- The tech is easy to setup and ship. Best used for Python REST API simple apps.


I decided to use a simple database to keep track of url access count and also good design pattern. Using a db instead of memory hence allowing further development of the feature/app down the line.
